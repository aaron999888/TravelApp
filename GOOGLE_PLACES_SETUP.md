## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API key not configured" warning**
- Make sure you've updated the API key in `src/config/api.ts`
- Restart your development server after making changes

**"Failed to fetch restaurants" error**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API key is correct
- Ensure the Places API is enabled in Google Cloud Console

**No restaurants found**
- Check if location permission is granted
- Try moving to a different location
- Verify you're in an area with restaurants

**Location permission denied**

## API Usage and Billing

- The Places API has a free tier with limited requests
- Monitor your usage in Google Cloud Console
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges
- Consider implementing caching to reduce API calls

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys to version control**
2. **Use environment variables in production**
3. **Restrict API keys to specific apps/IPs**
4. **Regularly rotate API keys**
5. **Monitor API usage for unusual activity**
